Prompt to generate a concise, professional README.md

Still __Testing__


- ChatGPT never gets the backticks right and always messes the format. This should be take care of the issue. 


## Prompt:

```md
I am providing information about an HTML/CSS project. Please generate a GitHub-ready README.md using the following instructions:

1. Structure the README with these sections:
	- **Project Title**: Use a clear, descriptive title.
	- **Description**: Provide a maximum of 2 paragraphs explaining what the project does, key concepts, CSS/HTML techniques, and functionality. Avoid subjective adjectives like "playful" or "imaginative."
	- **Project Status**: Indicate completion or work-in-progress with date. Include any revisited notes if applicable.
	- **Live Demo**: Provide a link to any live demo if available.
	- **Reference / Tutorial**: Optional links to tutorial or learning resources.
	- **Technologies Used**: List all technologies, CSS/HTML techniques, and dependencies.
	- **Project Files & Concepts**: Include a table listing the files, descriptive titles, and key concepts illustrated.
	- **Setup Instructions**: Simple steps to download or copy files and open them.
	- **How to Use or Extend**: Suggestions for experimentation or extension, including variable editing, animations, and responsiveness.

2. Formatting requirements:
	- Use Markdown suitable for GitHub.
	- Use tabs with triple backticks for code blocks and file names (not the same-level backticks as the surrounding Markdown).
	- Avoid emojis unless itâ€™s a warning or important note.
	- Keep the README concise and professional.
	- Ensure all links and references are included if provided.
