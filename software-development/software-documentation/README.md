# Software Documentation Prompts

This folder contains prompts focused on **documenting software projects**.  

Here, I experiment with AI to:
- Add **inline comments** to HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other code.
- Generating documentation for larger projects.  
- Generate **README** files.  
- Create other types of **software documentation**, like diagrams or overviews  

The goal is to make it easier and save time in generating and maintaining documentation, and thus, making codebases easier to navigate and understand.
