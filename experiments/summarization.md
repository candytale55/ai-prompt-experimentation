So, Prince Hamlet is vibing in Denmark when his dad gets offed, and his shady uncle Claudius snatches both the throne *and* Hamlet‚Äôs mom‚Äîbig yikes. Ghost Dad slides in like, ‚ÄúBro, I was murdered, avenge me.‚Äù Hamlet spirals into an existential crisis, ghosting everyone, dropping cryptic hot takes like ‚Äúto be or not to be.‚Äù He stages a play to clap back at Claudius, chaos ensues, and almost the entire cast rage-quits life via poison or stabbings. Endgame: Hamlet dies too, but not before exposing the sus uncle. Denmark: wrecked. Moral? Trust issues + indecision = messy vibes.

Knowledge graph

Example conceptual diagram
In knowledge representation and reasoning, a knowledge graph is a knowledge base that uses a graph-structured data model or topology to represent and operate on data. Knowledge graphs are often used to store interlinked descriptions of entities ‚Äì objects, events, situations or abstract concepts ‚Äì while also encoding the free-form semantics or relationships underlying these entities.[1][2]

Since the development of the Semantic Web, knowledge graphs have often been associated with linked open data projects, focusing on the connections between concepts and entities.[3][4] They are also historically associated with and used by search engines such as Google, Bing, and Yahoo; knowledge engines and question-answering services such as WolframAlpha, Apple's Siri, and Amazon Alexa; and social networks such as LinkedIn and Facebook.

Recent developments in data science and machine learning, particularly in graph neural networks and representation learning and also in machine learning, have broadened the scope of knowledge graphs beyond their traditional use in search engines and recommender systems. They are increasingly used in scientific research, with notable applications in fields such as genomics, proteomics, and systems biology.[5]

History
The term was coined as early as 1972 by the Austrian linguist Edgar W. Schneider, in a discussion of how to build modular instructional systems for courses.[6] In the late 1980s, the University of Groningen and University of Twente jointly began a project called Knowledge Graphs, focusing on the design of semantic networks with edges restricted to a limited set of relations, to facilitate algebras on the graph.[7] In subsequent decades, the distinction between semantic networks and knowledge graphs was blurred.

Some early knowledge graphs were topic-specific. In 1985, Wordnet was founded, capturing semantic relationships between words and meanings ‚Äì an application of this idea to language itself. In 2005, Marc Wirk founded Geonames to capture relationships between different geographic names and locales and associated entities. In 1998 Andrew Edmonds of Science in Finance Ltd in the UK created a system called ThinkBase that offered fuzzy-logic based reasoning in a graphical context.[8]

In 2007, both DBpedia and Freebase were founded as graph-based knowledge repositories for general-purpose knowledge.[9] DBpedia focused exclusively on data extracted from Wikipedia, while Freebase also included a range of public datasets. Neither described themselves as a 'knowledge graph' but developed and described related concepts.

In 2012, Google introduced their Knowledge Graph,[10] building on DBpedia and Freebase among other sources. They later incorporated RDFa, Microdata, JSON-LD content extracted from indexed web pages, including the CIA World Factbook, Wikidata, and Wikipedia.[10][11] Entity and relationship types associated with this knowledge graph have been further organized using terms from the schema.org[12] vocabulary. The Google Knowledge Graph became a successful complement to string-based search within Google, and its popularity online brought the term into more common use.[12]

Since then, several large multinationals have advertised their knowledge graphs use, further popularising the term. These include Facebook, LinkedIn, Airbnb, Microsoft, Amazon, Uber and eBay.[13]

In 2019, IEEE combined its annual international conferences on "Big Knowledge" and "Data Mining and Intelligent Computing" into the International Conference on Knowledge Graph.[14]

Definitions
There is no single commonly accepted definition of a knowledge graph. Most definitions view the topic through a Semantic Web lens and include these features:[15]

Flexible relations among knowledge in topical domains: A knowledge graph (i) defines abstract classes and relations of entities in a schema, (ii) mainly describes real world entities and their interrelations, organized in a graph, (iii) allows for potentially interrelating arbitrary entities with each other, and (iv) covers various topical domains.[16]
General structure: A network of entities, their semantic types, properties, and relationships.[17][18] To represent properties, categorical or numerical values are often used.
Supporting reasoning over inferred ontologies: A knowledge graph acquires and integrates information into an ontology and applies a reasoner to derive new knowledge.[3]
There are, however, many knowledge graph representations for which some of these features are not relevant. For those knowledge graphs, this simpler definition may be more useful:

A digital structure that represents knowledge as concepts and the relationships between them (facts). A knowledge graph can include an ontology that allows both humans and machines to understand and reason about its contents.[19][20]
Implementations
In addition to the above examples, the term has been used to describe open knowledge projects such as YAGO and Wikidata; federations like the Linked Open Data cloud;[21] a range of commercial search tools, including Yahoo's semantic search assistant Spark, Google's Knowledge Graph, and Microsoft's Satori; and the LinkedIn and Facebook entity graphs.[3]

The term is also used in the context of note-taking software applications that allow a user to build a personal knowledge graph.[22]

The popularization of knowledge graphs and their accompanying methods have led to the development of graph databases such as Neo4j,[23] GraphDB[24] and AgensGraph.[25] These graph databases allow users to easily store data as entities and their interrelationships, and facilitate operations such as data reasoning, node embedding, and ontology development on knowledge bases.

In contrast, virtual knowledge graphs do not store information in specialized databases.[26] They rely on an underlying relational database or data lake to answer queries on the graph. Such a virtual knowledge graph system must be properly configured in order to answer the queries correctly. This specific configuration is done through a set of mappings that define the relationship between the elements of the data source and the structure and ontology of the virtual knowledge graph.[27]

Using a knowledge graph for reasoning over data
Main article: Ontology (information science)
A knowledge graph formally represents semantics by describing entities and their relationships.[28] Knowledge graphs may make use of ontologies as a schema layer. By doing this, they allow logical inference for retrieving implicit knowledge rather than only allowing queries requesting explicit knowledge.[29]

In order to allow the use of knowledge graphs in various machine learning tasks, several methods for deriving latent feature representations of entities and relations have been devised.[30] These knowledge graph embeddings allow them to be connected to machine learning methods that require feature vectors like word embeddings. This can complement other estimates of conceptual similarity.[31][32]

Models for generating useful knowledge graph embeddings are commonly the domain of graph neural networks (GNNs).[33] GNNs are deep learning architectures that comprise edges and nodes, which correspond well to the entities and relationships of knowledge graphs. The topology and data structures afforded by GNNs provides a convenient domain for semi-supervised learning, wherein the network is trained to predict the value of a node embedding (provided a group of adjacent nodes and their edges) or edge (provided a pair of nodes). These tasks serve as fundamental abstractions for more complex tasks such as knowledge graph reasoning and alignment.[34]

Entity alignment

Two hypothetical knowledge graphs representing disparate topics contain a node that corresponds to the same entity in the real world. Entity alignment is the process of identifying such nodes across multiple graphs.
As new knowledge graphs are produced across a variety of fields and contexts, the same entity will inevitably be represented in multiple graphs. However, because no single standard for the construction or representation of knowledge graph exists, resolving which entities from disparate graphs correspond to the same real world subject is a non-trivial task. This task is known as knowledge graph entity alignment, and is an active area of research.[35]

Strategies for entity alignment generally seek to identify similar substructures, semantic relationships, shared attributes, or combinations of all three between two distinct knowledge graphs.[36] Entity alignment methods use these structural similarities between generally non-isomorphic graphs to predict which nodes corresponds to the same entity.[37]

The recent successes of large language models (LLMs), in particular their effectiveness at producing syntactically meaningful embeddings, has spurred the use of LLMs in the task of entity alignment.[38]

As the amount of data stored in knowledge graphs grows, developing dependable methods for knowledge graph entity alignment becomes an increasingly crucial step in the integration and cohesion of knowledge graph data.

A **knowledge graph (KG)** is a graph-structured knowledge base that encodes entities (objects, events, concepts) and their semantic relationships. Rooted in **Semantic Web** technologies and linked data, KGs have been deployed in search engines (Google, Bing, Yahoo), intelligent assistants (Siri, Alexa, WolframAlpha), and social networks (Facebook, LinkedIn).

Historically, the concept dates back to the 1970s with semantic networks, evolving through systems such as **WordNet (1985)**, **GeoNames (2005)**, **DBpedia (2007)**, and **Freebase (2007)**, with Google‚Äôs **Knowledge Graph (2012)** popularizing the term via integration of **RDFa, JSON-LD, and schema.org vocabularies**. Modern KGs are used in domains like **genomics, proteomics, and systems biology**.

Technically, a KG is defined by:

* a **schema layer (ontology)** encoding entity classes, relations, and attributes,
* **graph structure** of entities, properties, and relationships,
* **reasoning support** for ontology-based inference.

Implementations include **graph databases** (Neo4j, GraphDB, AgensGraph) for persistent storage and **virtual knowledge graphs** for query federation over relational sources. KGs support advanced operations such as **knowledge graph embeddings** (vectorized entity/relation representations) enabling integration with **machine learning (ML)**, particularly **graph neural networks (GNNs)** for semi-supervised learning, reasoning, and alignment.

A major challenge is **entity alignment**, i.e., resolving correspondences of entities across heterogeneous KGs, often tackled through structural similarity, semantic attributes, or embeddings. Recent methods leverage **large language models (LLMs)** for improved alignment and representation learning.

Overall, KGs provide a flexible, ontology-driven framework for representing, reasoning, and integrating knowledge across diverse application domains.

**What is a knowledge graph?**
A knowledge graph is a way of storing and organizing information in the form of a graph, where entities (things like people, places, events, or ideas) are shown as nodes, and their relationships are shown as links between them. This helps both humans and machines understand and reason about data.

---

**Uses of knowledge graphs:**

* Search engines (Google, Bing, Yahoo)
* Voice assistants (Siri, Alexa, WolframAlpha)
* Social networks (Facebook, LinkedIn)
* Scientific research (genomics, biology, etc.)
* Recommendation systems

---

**History:**

* The term dates back to the 1970s.
* Early projects: *WordNet* (1985, word meanings), *Geonames* (2005, geographic names), *ThinkBase* (1998, reasoning system).
* 2007: *DBpedia* and *Freebase* made general-purpose knowledge graphs.
* 2012: Google launched its **Knowledge Graph**, popularizing the concept.
* Now, many big companies (Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, etc.) use them.

---

**Key features of knowledge graphs:**

1. Represent real-world entities and their relationships.
2. Organize information in a flexible, network-like structure.
3. Can include ontologies (formal schemas) to allow reasoning and infer new knowledge.

---

**How they work with technology:**

* **Databases**: Stored in graph databases like Neo4j or GraphDB.
* **Virtual knowledge graphs**: Don‚Äôt store the data directly, but connect to existing databases.
* **Machine learning**: Used with graph neural networks (GNNs) to predict relationships, learn patterns, and improve reasoning.

---

**Challenges ‚Äì Entity Alignment:**
Different graphs may describe the same real-world thing in different ways. Matching these correctly (called **entity alignment**) is a complex but important problem. Large language models (like modern AI) are now helping with this.

---

üëâ **In short:**
A knowledge graph is a network-like digital structure that connects facts and concepts through relationships. It started as a research idea decades ago, became widely known after Google‚Äôs Knowledge Graph, and is now used in search, AI, science, and business.

A **knowledge graph** is like a giant **map of facts**.

* The dots on the map are things (like people, places, or ideas).
* The lines between the dots show how those things are connected.

Big companies like Google, Siri, and Alexa use these maps to answer questions. Scientists also use them to study stuff like genes and biology.

People started making these fact-maps a long time ago, and they‚Äôve grown bigger and smarter. Today, they help computers not just *store* facts, but also *figure out new ones*.

Sometimes, two maps talk about the same thing in different ways. Figuring out that it‚Äôs really the same thing is called **entity alignment**‚Äîkind of like matching puzzle pieces.

So, a knowledge graph is basically a **smart web of facts and connections** that helps humans and computers understand the world better.

# Executive Summary

This report analyzes the events and outcomes of *Romeo and Juliet*, a Shakespearean case study in inter-family conflict, stakeholder mismanagement, and risk escalation. The tragedy highlights the consequences of poor communication, rigid organizational silos (Montague vs. Capulet), and unmitigated youthful decision-making. The project ends with the loss of two principal heirs, generating significant reputational and emotional costs, but achieving unintended reconciliation between stakeholders.

---

# Background

* **Key Stakeholders**:

  * Montague Family (Romeo as heir apparent)
  * Capulet Family (Juliet as heir apparent)
  * Neutral Parties: Prince Escalus (regulator), Friar Lawrence (advisor), Mercutio, Paris.

* **Industry Environment**:

  * Longstanding rivalry between Montagues and Capulets.
  * High volatility in Verona‚Äôs social and political landscape.

---

# Problem Statement

Persistent inter-family conflict created barriers to collaboration and sustainability. Romeo and Juliet‚Äôs attempt to form a strategic alliance (marriage) was executed covertly without stakeholder approval, resulting in escalating risks.

---

# Key Events (Timeline of Incidents)

1. **Initial Conflict**: Street brawl between Montague and Capulet staff highlights ongoing hostility.
2. **Unauthorized Engagement**: Romeo and Juliet initiate a secret partnership (marriage).
3. **Escalation**: Romeo kills Tybalt, causing regulatory sanctions (banishment).
4. **Crisis Management Attempt**: Friar Lawrence designs risk-mitigation strategy (sleeping potion).
5. **Communication Breakdown**: Critical message fails to reach Romeo.
6. **Catastrophic Outcome**: Romeo and Juliet independently execute fatal actions, leading to dual losses.

---

# Analysis

* **Root Causes**:

  * Lack of transparent communication channels.
  * Poor change management by family leadership.
  * Over-reliance on informal advisors.
  * Impulsive decision-making by junior stakeholders.

* **Impact**:

  * Loss of next-generation leadership.
  * Emotional and reputational damages across families.
  * Forced reconciliation only after irreversible costs.

---

# Recommendations

1. **Conflict Resolution Framework**: Establish structured negotiation between rival organizations to mitigate risk.
2. **Succession Planning**: Identify and safeguard next-generation leaders.
3. **Improved Communication Systems**: Ensure critical information is reliably transmitted to avoid fatal misunderstandings.
4. **Stakeholder Training**: Provide education on strategic patience, risk assessment, and crisis management.

---

# Conclusion

*Romeo and Juliet* demonstrates the high cost of unresolved stakeholder conflict and inadequate risk management. While reconciliation was achieved, the losses incurred outweighed the benefits. Future organizational strategies should prioritize communication, transparency, and structured mediation to avoid repeat outcomes.

## 1. **Overview**

*Romeo and Juliet* was written around 1595 and is based on an older Italian tale of two ‚Äústar-crossed lovers.‚Äù It is set in **Verona, Italy**, and follows the doomed romance between Romeo Montague and Juliet Capulet, whose families are embroiled in a bitter feud. Despite their efforts to overcome family hatred, fate and miscommunication lead to their tragic deaths.

---

## 2. **Themes**

### ‚öîÔ∏è Love and Hate

* The central tension arises from the clash between love (Romeo and Juliet‚Äôs passion) and hate (the feud between Montagues and Capulets).
* Shakespeare presents love as transformative, reckless, and transcendent, but also destructive when pitted against entrenched hostility.

### ‚è≥ Fate and Free Will

* The play opens with the famous line ‚Äústar-crossed lovers,‚Äù suggesting destiny controls their lives.
* Yet, characters‚Äô impulsive choices (Romeo killing Tybalt, Juliet faking her death) also propel the tragedy.
* Shakespeare blurs the line between fate and human error.

### üåô Youth vs. Age

* The younger characters act impulsively and passionately (Romeo, Juliet, Tybalt, Mercutio).
* Older figures (Friar Lawrence, the Nurse, Lord Capulet) offer guidance but often fail them with poor judgment.

### üïäÔ∏è Death as an Escape

* Death is intertwined with love throughout: Romeo and Juliet consummate their relationship under the shadow of mortality.
* Their suicides, paradoxically, resolve the feud and bring peace.

---

## 3. **Characters**

* **Romeo Montague**: Romantic, impulsive, idealistic. He shifts quickly from infatuation with Rosaline to deep love for Juliet, showing youthful intensity. His passion drives the plot forward but also causes rash decisions.

* **Juliet Capulet**: Intelligent, determined, and more practical than Romeo. She matures rapidly during the play, balancing youthful innocence with bold defiance of her family.

* **Friar Lawrence**: A well-meaning but flawed mentor. His plans, aimed at reconciling the families, instead hasten tragedy.

* **The Nurse**: Comic relief and Juliet‚Äôs confidante. Ultimately, she fails to fully support Juliet‚Äôs decision to remain loyal to Romeo.

* **Mercutio**: Romeo‚Äôs witty, provocative friend. His death marks the turning point from comedy to tragedy.

* **Tybalt**: Juliet‚Äôs hot-tempered cousin, representing the destructive pride and hatred of the feud.

* **Lord & Lady Capulet, Lord & Lady Montague**: Authority figures bound by tradition, fueling conflict rather than resolving it.

---

## 4. **Structure and Language**

### Structure

* The play blends **comedy, romance, and tragedy**‚Äîstarting with playful banter and escalating into devastating loss.
* Divided into five acts, with Act III (Mercutio‚Äôs death and Romeo‚Äôs banishment) serving as the turning point.

### Language

* Heavy use of **oxymorons** (e.g., ‚ÄúO brawling love! O loving hate!‚Äù) to express love-hate tension.
* Frequent **light/dark imagery**: Juliet as the sun, love hidden at night, death described as eternal rest.
* **Religious imagery**: Their love is often framed in spiritual terms, elevating it above earthly concerns.
* Use of **sonnet form**: Romeo and Juliet‚Äôs first meeting creates a perfect 14-line sonnet, symbolizing harmony.

---

## 5. **Symbolism**

* **Poison**: Represents both death and healing, as Friar Lawrence notes. It embodies the fine line between remedy and destruction.
* **Light and Darkness**: Their love flourishes at night, hidden from the hateful world of day.
* **The Stars**: Repeated references to astrology highlight fate‚Äôs power over human lives.

---

## 6. **Critical Interpretations**

# Comparative Study: *Romeo and Juliet* and *The Lovers of Teruel*

## Introduction

*Romeo and Juliet* (1597), a tragedy by William Shakespeare, and *The Lovers of Teruel*, a 13th-century Spanish legend, are two timeless love stories rooted in the theme of tragic romance. Despite their different cultural origins‚ÄîElizabethan England and medieval Spain‚Äîthey share striking similarities in plot, themes, and moral lessons, while also diverging in tone, narrative structure, and cultural context.

---

## Historical and Cultural Context

* **Romeo and Juliet**: Written during the English Renaissance, influenced by Italian novellas and courtly love traditions. Shakespeare‚Äôs play reflects the Elizabethan fascination with fate, family honor, and the dangers of passion unchecked by reason.
* **The Lovers of Teruel**: Originating in 13th-century Aragon (Spain), the legend reflects medieval notions of honor, social class, and the religious idea of divine justice. It was transmitted orally and later written down, becoming a symbol of Spanish cultural identity and romantic fidelity.

---

## Plot and Characters

* **Romeo and Juliet**: Two young lovers from rival families (Montagues and Capulets) fall in love, secretly marry, and ultimately die in a series of misunderstandings.
* **The Lovers of Teruel (Diego de Marcilla and Isabel de Segura)**: Diego, a poor nobleman, loves Isabel, whose wealthy father demands he gain riches before marriage. After five years abroad, Diego returns too late‚ÄîIsabel is married to another. He dies of grief, and she dies soon after, unable to bear the loss.

**Similarities:**

* Both stories center on forbidden love thwarted by social constraints (family feud vs. class expectations).
* The lovers‚Äô deaths are caused by forces outside their control‚Äîfate, time, or social order.
* The heroines (Juliet and Isabel) are torn between filial duty and romantic passion.

**Differences:**

* In *Romeo and Juliet*, both lovers actively choose death (suicide); in *The Lovers of Teruel*, death comes through heartbreak and circumstance.
* Shakespeare‚Äôs play has a larger cast, with subplots (Mercutio, the Nurse, Paris), while *The Lovers of Teruel* remains focused on the couple.

---

## Themes

* **Love and Fate:** Both stories highlight love as powerful but fragile, often subject to destiny‚Äôs cruelty.
* **Family and Social Constraint:** In Verona, family feud prevents union; in Teruel, wealth and honor prevent marriage.
* **Death as Unity:** Death becomes the only space where lovers are united, symbolizing eternal fidelity.
* **Individual vs. Society:** Both tales emphasize the tragic consequences when individual desires clash with collective rules.

---

## Tone and Style

* **Romeo and Juliet**: Poetic, dramatic, and infused with wit, humor, and irony. Shakespeare uses sonnets, metaphors, and foreshadowing to heighten the emotional intensity.
* **The Lovers of Teruel**: Simpler, more austere, and elegiac. The narrative reflects its medieval oral tradition, focusing on moral and emotional weight rather than dramatic complexity.

---

## Cultural Significance

* **Romeo and Juliet**: Became the quintessential Western love tragedy, influencing literature, music, opera, and film globally.
* **The Lovers of Teruel**: Deeply rooted in Spanish tradition, commemorated annually in Teruel with festivals and preserved through art, theater, and even the mausoleum where the lovers‚Äô effigies rest.

---

## Conclusion

Both *Romeo and Juliet* and *The Lovers of Teruel* serve as cultural mirrors of their societies, articulating timeless concerns about love, honor, and fate. While Shakespeare emphasizes the destructive power of passion in a divided society, the Spanish legend underscores loyalty and the inexorability of time and social order. Together, they highlight how tragic love stories transcend borders, resonating universally across history and cultures.

**"Romeo & Juliet: A Tarantino Cut"**

Two crime families, the Montagues and Capulets, run the underworld of Verona‚Äîa neon-soaked city where violence is currency and grudges are older than the buildings. Instead of ballrooms, there are smoky clubs, gunfights in gas stations, and sharp dialogue that cuts harder than switchblades.

Romeo, a jittery, fast-talking Montague with more passion than sense, falls for Juliet, the sharp-eyed Capulet heiress who‚Äôs done with family politics. Their love explodes not in soft whispers on balconies, but in whispered plans while hiding pistols under the table.

Mercutio is the wildcard‚Äîpart philosopher, part chaos agent‚Äîwhose monologues about fate and love are interrupted by brutal brawls. Tybalt, all venom and swagger, is the Capulet enforcer with no chill, itching to make Verona bleed.

The love story spirals in typical Tarantino fashion: non-linear cuts between neon-lit confrontations, tense standoffs, and jukebox-fueled conversations about destiny. Every act is punctuated by sudden, shocking bursts of violence‚ÄîMercutio‚Äôs death is operatic in blood and wit, and Tybalt‚Äôs showdown feels like a spaghetti western in downtown Verona.

The finale doesn‚Äôt play out with soft tragedy, but with Tarantino‚Äôs signature mix of irony and style: gun smoke, slow-motion collapses, and a jukebox crooning something absurdly upbeat as the young lovers choose each other over the world. The crime families arrive too late, standing in the carnage of their own feud.

The credits roll over a blood-smeared cityscape, leaving the audience wondering if love ever stood a chance‚Äîor if Verona was always just another Tarantino town where bullets speak louder than words.

### **Plot Overview**

Shakespeare‚Äôs *Romeo and Juliet* follows two young lovers from feuding families in Verona, the Montagues and the Capulets. Their love story, set against a backdrop of violence and social division, unfolds rapidly over just a few days and ends in tragedy.

---

### **Exposition**

The play begins with a street brawl between Montague and Capulet servants, establishing the intensity of the family feud. We meet Romeo, melancholic over unrequited love for Rosaline, and Juliet, who is being pressured by her parents to consider marrying Paris.

---

### **Rising Action**

* Romeo sneaks into a Capulet party, where he meets Juliet, and they fall instantly in love.
* With the help of Friar Laurence and Juliet‚Äôs Nurse, the two secretly marry the next day, hoping their union might heal the feud.
* The tension escalates when Tybalt, Juliet‚Äôs cousin, kills Romeo‚Äôs friend Mercutio. In revenge, Romeo kills Tybalt, leading to his banishment from Verona.

---

### **Climax**

The lovers are separated: Romeo flees to Mantua, while Juliet faces pressure to marry Paris. In desperation, Juliet turns to Friar Laurence, who devises a risky plan involving a sleeping potion that will make her appear dead. The climax centers on the failed communication of this plan‚ÄîRomeo never receives the message explaining Juliet‚Äôs feigned death.

---

### **Falling Action**

Romeo, believing Juliet is truly dead, returns to Verona. He kills Paris outside Juliet‚Äôs tomb and then takes poison beside her. Moments later, Juliet awakens, finds Romeo dead, and stabs herself with his dagger.

---

### **Resolution**

The deaths of Romeo and Juliet finally reconcile the Montagues and Capulets, who agree to end their feud after realizing the destructive cost of hatred.

---

### **Plot Analysis**

* **Compression of time:** The entire story unfolds in less than a week, heightening the intensity and impulsivity of the lovers‚Äô choices.
* **Cause-and-effect chain:** Almost every major event is a reaction to a previous action (Romeo kills Tybalt ‚Üí banishment ‚Üí secret plan ‚Üí tragic miscommunication).
* **Dramatic irony:** The audience is constantly aware of the characters‚Äô misunderstandings (e.g., Juliet‚Äôs ‚Äúdeath‚Äù), which intensifies the tragedy.
* **Conflict:** The central external conflict is the feud between families, but the internal conflict lies in Romeo and Juliet‚Äôs struggle between love and social obligation.

### Romeo

At the start, Romeo is portrayed as impulsive, immature, and consumed by infatuation‚Äîhe is in despair over Rosaline, demonstrating his tendency toward intense but shallow passion. When he meets Juliet, however, his love takes on a deeper and more serious quality. He matures emotionally, showing loyalty, devotion, and a willingness to defy his family and society. Still, his impulsiveness persists‚Äîseen in his rapid decision to marry Juliet, his rash killing of Tybalt, and ultimately his choice to end his life without pausing to seek alternatives. His arc illustrates a shift from fickle youth to a man driven by profound, if reckless, love.

### Juliet

Juliet begins as obedient, sheltered, and hesitant about love‚Äîshe tells her mother she will only look at Paris ‚Äúif looking liking move.‚Äù Meeting Romeo transforms her quickly: she becomes bold, assertive, and independent, making choices that place her in direct conflict with her family‚Äôs expectations. Unlike Romeo, she demonstrates a cautious wisdom at first (questioning the speed of their relationship, insisting marriage must precede intimacy). But her love grows into fierce determination, and like Romeo, she embraces risk and ultimately chooses death over a life without him. Her growth is striking: she moves from a passive daughter to a decisive woman who takes control of her fate.

### Secondary Characters

* **Mercutio**: Witty, irreverent, and skeptical of romantic love, he serves as Romeo‚Äôs foil. His death is a turning point, marking the shift from playful romance to deadly tragedy.
* **Friar Lawrence**: Initially a voice of reason and moderation (‚ÄúWisely and slow; they stumble that run fast‚Äù), he enables the secret marriage. His good intentions are undone by miscommunication and fate, showing the limits of wisdom in the face of impulsive passion.
* **The Nurse**: She begins as Juliet‚Äôs confidante and supporter but ultimately retreats to pragmatism, advising Juliet to marry Paris. This betrayal isolates Juliet further, reinforcing her independence.

### Overall Development

The tragedy lies in how both Romeo and Juliet evolve: love propels them into maturity and agency, but their passion outruns their judgment. Their development is compressed and intensified by the feud-driven world around them, and their final acts‚Äîsuicide in devotion to one another‚Äîrepresent both their greatest independence and their ultimate downfall.

<!-- prompt:start -->
**Prompt**
```md
**Romeo and Juliet** by William Shakespeare is a tragedy that explores the destructive power of love caught in a web of fate, family conflict, and youthful passion.

* **Love and Passion**: The central theme is the intensity of young love. Romeo and Juliet‚Äôs affection is immediate, overwhelming, and defies social conventions. Their love, though pure and idealized, is also reckless, leading them to impulsive decisions.

* **Fate and Destiny**: From the opening ‚Äústar-cross‚Äôd lovers‚Äù reference, the play frames their relationship as doomed by fate. Coincidence, bad timing, and miscommunication drive the story toward tragedy, underscoring the inevitability of their end.

* **Conflict and Violence**: The feud between the Montagues and Capulets embodies senseless hatred and inherited violence. Love and hate intertwine throughout the play, showing how personal desires are crushed by collective hostility.

* **Youth vs. Age**: The passionate urgency of the young lovers contrasts with the cautious, often rigid, perspectives of their elders. The impulsivity of youth highlights both the beauty and danger of unchecked emotion.

* **Individual vs. Society**: Romeo and Juliet struggle to define their own identities and choices within a society governed by family honor and rigid expectations. Their defiance represents a yearning for personal freedom that tragically clashes with social order.

---

In essence, the play dramatizes how love, though transcendent and transformative, can be overwhelmed by external forces of fate, violence, and societal constraint‚Äîturning passion into tragedy.

Got it! Let‚Äôs frame **Romeo and Juliet** through a **technical/analytical lens**, highlighting structure, mechanisms, and "system design" aspects of the play:

---

### **System Overview**

* **Genre/System Type**: Tragedy (a failure mode within the dramatic system).
* **Author**: William Shakespeare.
* **Primary Function**: Depict the destructive consequences of inter-family conflict (a persistent bug in the Verona social system).

---

### **Core Components**

* **Actors (Modules)**:

  * **Romeo Montague** (protagonist subsystem, impulsive process).
  * **Juliet Capulet** (co-protagonist subsystem, equally passionate, high-risk decision maker).
  * **Montagues & Capulets** (legacy systems in conflict, generating recurring errors).
  * **Friar Lawrence** (integration module, attempts to bridge systems, introduces flawed patch).
  * **Mercutio, Tybalt, Nurse** (supporting processes adding instability).

---

### **Architecture & Flow**

1. **Initialization**: The Montague‚ÄìCapulet feud is a persistent fault in the environment.
2. **Trigger Event**: Romeo and Juliet‚Äôs unexpected ‚Äúcross-system communication‚Äù (love at first sight).
3. **Secret Integration**: They establish a hidden protocol (marriage), bypassing legacy system restrictions.
4. **System Conflict Escalation**: Tybalt‚Äôs aggression + Romeo‚Äôs retaliation ‚Üí cascading failure (banishment).
5. **Patch Deployment**: Friar Lawrence‚Äôs ‚Äúsleeping potion plan‚Äù (temporary suspension of Juliet‚Äôs process to fake death).
6. **Signal Transmission Failure**: Message to Romeo does not propagate correctly (communication breakdown in distributed system).
7. **Fatal Error Handling**: Romeo executes self-termination routine (suicide), Juliet reboots into consciousness, detects fatal state, executes own termination.
8. **System Shutdown**: Both processes terminated, feud error exposed; families reconcile (belated system fix).

---

### **Key Technical Concepts**

* **Concurrency**: Romeo and Juliet‚Äôs actions operate in parallel but without synchronization, leading to deadlock.
* **Fault Tolerance**: Low ‚Äî system fails catastrophically upon miscommunication.
* **Latency Issue**: Critical message delay causes entire tragedy (timing bug).
* **Human Factors**: High emotional ‚Äúoverclocking‚Äù leads to system instability.
* **Final Output**: Resolution achieved only after complete subsystem collapse (Romeo + Juliet deaths).

---

‚öôÔ∏è In short: *Romeo and Juliet* is essentially a **case study in failed system integration**, where poor communication protocols, untested contingency plans, and rigid legacy constraints lead to **catastrophic failure of both subsystems**, prompting a post-mortem redesign (peace between families).

---

### **Before the War**

* **1931** ‚Äì The monarchy falls; the **Second Spanish Republic** is declared. Political polarization grows between the left (republicans, socialists, anarchists) and the right (monarchists, conservatives, fascists, and the military).
* **1933‚Äì1936** ‚Äì Governments swing between left-leaning and right-leaning coalitions. Rising unrest, strikes, land disputes, and church‚Äìstate conflict destabilize the country.
* **Feb 1936** ‚Äì The **Popular Front (left-wing coalition)** wins elections. Right-wing groups fear radical reforms; conspiracies to overthrow the Republic grow within the military.

---

### **1936: The Outbreak**

* **July 17‚Äì18, 1936** ‚Äì A **military coup** led by General Francisco Franco and other officers begins in Spanish Morocco and quickly spreads to mainland Spain. The coup **fails to seize power everywhere**, splitting Spain between the **Republicans (loyal to the government)** and the **Nationalists (rebels led by Franco and others)**.
* By autumn 1936 ‚Äì The war escalates; **Madrid resists siege**, becoming a symbol of Republican defense.

### **1937: Intensification**

* **April 1937** ‚Äì **Guernica bombing** by German and Italian planes supporting Franco shocks the world.
* **May 1937** ‚Äì Internal fighting breaks out in Barcelona between anarchists and communists within the Republican camp (the ‚ÄúMay Days‚Äù), weakening the left.
* Nationalists gradually take control of northern Spain, securing industrial and resource-rich regions.

---

### **1938: Turning Point**

* **March‚ÄìApril 1938** ‚Äì Nationalists launch the **Aragon Offensive**, cutting Republican territory in two.
* **July‚ÄìNov 1938** ‚Äì The **Battle of the Ebro**, the Republic‚Äôs last major offensive, ends in a disastrous defeat.

---

### **1939: The End**

* **Jan 1939** ‚Äì Nationalists capture **Barcelona**, crushing Republican Catalonia.
* **March 1939** ‚Äì Madrid falls to Franco‚Äôs forces after internal Republican divisions.
* **April 1, 1939** ‚Äì Franco declares victory; the **Spanish Civil War ends**.

---

### **Aftermath**

* **Franco‚Äôs dictatorship (1939‚Äì1975)** ‚Äì Repression of Republicans, censorship, and authoritarian rule.
* Hundreds of thousands flee into exile; tens of thousands executed or imprisoned.
* Spain remains neutral in WWII but aligned ideologically with fascist regimes.

```md
Here‚Äôs a clear bullet-point summary of the main causes of the Spanish Civil War (1936‚Äì1939):

* **Deep Political Polarization**

  * Spain was divided between conservatives (monarchists, landowners, Catholic Church, army) and progressives (republicans, socialists, anarchists, and communists).
  * Weak democratic traditions made compromise difficult.

* **Economic Inequality and Land Issues**

  * Vast rural poverty: land concentrated in the hands of a few large landowners, especially in southern Spain.
  * Calls for agrarian reform faced fierce resistance from elites.

* **Regional Nationalism**

  * Catalonia and the Basque Country pushed for autonomy or independence.
  * Central government resisted, fueling resentment.

* **Weakness of the Second Spanish Republic (1931‚Äì1936)**

  * Liberal reforms (land redistribution, secularization, military reduction) alienated conservatives, monarchists, and the Catholic Church.
  * Swinging governments (left-wing, then right-wing coalitions) created instability and mistrust.

* **Role of the Army**

  * Traditionally powerful and conservative, the army resisted reform.
  * Many officers feared the erosion of their influence.

* **Rise of Extremist Politics**

  * Growth of anarchist and socialist movements on the left.
  * Emergence of the Falange (fascist movement) on the right, inspired by Mussolini and Hitler.

* **Violence and Political Unrest**

  * Street clashes, strikes, assassinations, and political violence escalated in the early 1930s.
  * July 1936: the assassination of conservative leader Jos√© Calvo Sotelo triggered the military uprising.

* **Foreign Influence and Ideology**

  * Fascism (Italy, Germany) and communism (Soviet Union) influenced Spanish factions.
  * The conflict became part of the wider ideological struggle between right and left in Europe.

Here is a **Q&A-style summary** of *‚ÄúAttention Is All You Need‚Äù* (Vaswani et al., 2017) ([arXiv][1])

---

## Q1: What problem does the paper tackle?

**A1:** The paper addresses sequence transduction tasks (e.g. machine translation) and proposes a new neural architecture that **relies entirely on attention mechanisms**, removing recurrence (RNNs, LSTMs) and convolution from the model. ([arXiv][1])

---

## Q2: What is the core idea / ‚Äúinnovation‚Äù of the paper?

**A2:** The core idea is the **Transformer** architecture, which uses layers of **self-attention** and **feed-forward networks** (plus residual connections and normalization), in both the encoder and decoder, without using RNNs or CNNs. ([arXiv][1])

Specifically:

* Use **scaled dot-product attention** as the attention mechanism. ([arXiv][1])
* Use **multi-head attention**: project inputs into multiple ‚Äúheads‚Äù, perform attention in parallel, then combine. ([arXiv][1])
* Add **positional encodings** to embeddings to inject order information (since there is no recurrence) ([arXiv][1])
* Use **position-wise feed-forward** networks applied independently at each position ([arXiv][1])
* Use residual connections + layer normalization around sub-layers ([arXiv][1])

---

## Q3: What do the encoder and decoder look like in the Transformer?

**A3:**

* **Encoder:** A stack of (N) identical layers, each with two sub-layers:
  ‚ÄÉ1. Multi-head self-attention
  ‚ÄÉ2. Position-wise feed-forward network
  Each sub-layer is wrapped with a residual connection + layer normalization. ([arXiv][1])

* **Decoder:** Also a stack of (N) identical layers, but each layer has three sub-layers:
  ‚ÄÉ1. Masked multi-head self-attention (so positions cannot ‚Äúsee the future‚Äù)
  ‚ÄÉ2. Multi-head attention over encoder outputs (encoder‚Äìdecoder attention)
  ‚ÄÉ3. Position-wise feed-forward network
  Again, residual + normalization applied around each sub-layer. ([arXiv][1])

The masking in the decoder ensures the model is autoregressive (only attends to known outputs). ([arXiv][1])

---

## Q4: How is attention defined, and why ‚Äúscaled dot-product‚Äù?

**A4:**

* The general attention mechanism takes **queries** (Q), **keys** (K), and **values** (V). It computes compatibility scores between queries and keys, uses those to weight the values, and sums them. ([arXiv][1])
* The **scaled dot-product** version computes
  [
  \text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}!\Bigl(\frac{Q K^\top}{\sqrt{d_k}}\Bigr),V
  ]
  where (d_k) is the key dimensionality (used to scale down the dot products). ([arXiv][1])
* The scaling by (\sqrt{d_k}) is to prevent the dot products from becoming too large (which would push softmax into very flat gradients). ([arXiv][1])

The authors choose dot-product attention because it can be implemented efficiently with matrix multiplications. ([arXiv][1])

---

## Q5: What is multi-head attention, and why use it?

**A5:**

* In **multi-head attention**, the input queries, keys, and values are linearly projected (with separate learned linear maps) into multiple ‚Äúheads‚Äù (say (h) heads), each of lower dimension (e.g. (d_k, d_v)). Attention is computed in parallel on these projections, producing outputs which are then concatenated and linearly projected again. ([arXiv][1])
* The benefit is that each head can attend to different parts of the representation space or capture different types of relationships. This enables richer modeling capacity than a single attention head (which would average over attention). ([arXiv][1])

In this architecture, the cost of multi-head attention is comparable to that of a single-head attention of full dimensionality. ([arXiv][1])

---

## Q6: Why is self-attention (i.e. attention within a sequence) beneficial relative to RNNs or CNNs?

**A6:** The authors compare along three axes: computational complexity per layer, parallelizability, and **path length** (i.e. how many ‚Äúhops‚Äù a signal has to traverse between any two positions). ([arXiv][1])

* **Parallelism:** Self-attention allows more parallel computation than RNNs, because RNNs require sequential dependence. ([arXiv][1])
* **Shortest paths:** Self-attention gives **constant-length** paths (1 hop) between positions in a layer, which helps with learning long-range dependencies; in contrast, RNNs or convolutions require multiple steps or layers. ([arXiv][1])
* **Complexity trade-offs:** For sequence length (n) and representation dimension (d), self-attention is (O(n^2 \cdot d)). If (n) is smaller than (d), it's efficient compared to RNNs. For very long sequences, one could restrict attention to a local window (this is future work in the paper). ([arXiv][1])

They also argue that self-attention is more interpretable: attention weights can be visualized and appear to learn linguistic patterns. ([arXiv][1])

---

## Q7: How is the model trained (data, hyperparameters, regularization)?

**A7:**

* **Datasets:**
  ‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢ WMT 2014 English‚ÄìGerman (~4.5M parallel sentences) ([arXiv][1])
  ‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢ WMT 2014 English‚ÄìFrench (~36M sentence pairs) ([arXiv][1])
* **Tokenization / vocabulary:** Shared source-target vocabulary via byte-pair encoding for EN‚ÄìDE (~37,000 tokens). For EN‚ÄìFR, 32,000 word-piece vocabulary. ([arXiv][1])
* **Batching and steps:** Each batch ~25,000 source tokens + 25,000 target tokens; base model trained for 100,000 steps (~12 hours on 8 P100 GPUs). Big model trained for 300,000 steps (~3.5 days). ([arXiv][1])
* **Optimizer & learning rate schedule:** Use Adam with (\beta_1 = 0.9), (\beta_2 = 0.98). Learning rate is increased linearly during warmup, then decayed proportionally to the inverse square root of the step number. ([arXiv][1])
* **Regularization:**
  ‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢ Dropout applied to sub‚Äêlayer outputs and embeddings (with rate e.g. 0.1) ([arXiv][1])
  ‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢ Label smoothing with value 0.1 ([arXiv][1])

---

## Q8: What results do they obtain (especially in machine translation)?

**A8:**

* On **WMT 2014 English‚ÜíGerman**, their ‚Äúbig‚Äù Transformer reaches **BLEU = 28.4**, outperforming previous best models (including ensembles) by over 2 BLEU points. ([arXiv][1])
* On **WMT 2014 English‚ÜíFrench**, Transformer achieves **BLEU = 41.8**, setting new state of the art for single models. ([arXiv][1])
* The **base** model (smaller variant) already surpasses all prior published models and ensembles at lower computational cost. ([arXiv][1])
* They also try **model variants** (altering number of heads, key dimensions, dropout, positional encodings) and observe how performance changes‚Äîablation studies. ([arXiv][1])
* Beyond translation, they test on **English constituency parsing** (WSJ) with limited data: the Transformer performs competitively, generalizing beyond translation tasks. ([arXiv][1])

---

## Q9: What are the limitations, future directions, or caveats the authors mention?

**A9:**

* The (O(n^2)) self-attention cost can be a bottleneck for very long sequences; they suggest exploring **local/restricted attention** to mitigate that. ([arXiv][1])
* Generation in the decoder is still sequential (autoregressive)‚Äîthey mention interest in making generation less sequential. ([arXiv][1])
* The positional encoding scheme is a design choice; they compare learned vs sinusoidal encodings and observe similar results. ([arXiv][1])
* While their experiments focus mostly on translation, they suggest applying Transformers to other modalities (images, audio, video) in future work. ([arXiv][1])

---

## Q10: Why is this paper important / what is its impact in hindsight?

**A10:**

* It introduced the **Transformer** architecture, which became a foundational model paradigm for many subsequent breakthroughs in NLP (e.g. BERT, GPT, etc.).
* By removing recurrence and convolution, it allowed **high parallelism in training** and **efficient scaling to very large models & data**.
* Its design‚Äîself-attention, multi-head attention, position encoding, residual + normalization‚Äîhas become standard building blocks in modern models.
* The approach of purely attention-based models has been extended to many modalities (text, speech, images, cross-modal) and tasks (generation, classification, etc.).

<!-- prompt:start -->
**Prompt**
```md
Here‚Äôs a practical, step-by-step, guide-style summary of **‚ÄúAttention Is All You Need.‚Äù**

1. Define the goal
   Build a sequence-to-sequence model that drops RNNs/CNNs entirely and uses only attention, to gain parallelism and better long-range dependency modeling. This architecture is the **Transformer**. ([arXiv][1])

2. Use an encoder‚Äìdecoder layout
   Stack **N=6** identical layers in the encoder and **N=6** in the decoder. Each encoder layer = (a) multi-head **self-attention** ‚Üí (b) position-wise feed-forward network (FFN), each wrapped with residual + LayerNorm; decoder layers add a third sublayer for **encoder‚Äìdecoder attention**. Model width **d_model = 512** in the base setup. ([papers.neurips.cc][2])

3. Implement scaled dot-product attention
   Given queries Q, keys K, values V, compute `softmax(QK·µÄ / ‚àöd_k) V`. This is faster/more memory-efficient than additive attention, and the ‚àöd_k scaling stabilizes gradients when d_k is large. ([arXiv][1])

4. Make it **multi-head**
   Project (Q,K,V) into **h** subspaces, do attention in parallel, then concat and linearly project back. This lets the model attend to different information subspaces/positions simultaneously. (Base uses **h=8**, with per-head dimensions **d_k=d_v=64**.) ([arXiv][1])

5. Add masks for auto-regression
   In the decoder‚Äôs self-attention, **mask future positions** so token *t* can‚Äôt attend to *t+1‚Ä¶*. Encoder‚Äìdecoder attention lets every target position attend over all source positions. ([arXiv][1])

6. Add the position-wise feed-forward network
   Apply the same 2-layer FFN to each position independently: `FFN(x)=max(0, xW1+b1)W2+b2`. In the base model, the inner width is **d_ff = 2048**. ([arXiv][1])

7. Wrap with residual connections + LayerNorm
   Each sublayer returns `LayerNorm(x + Sublayer(x))`. Keep all sublayer outputs at dimension **d_model** to make the residuals valid. ([papers.neurips.cc][2])

8. Inject token order with **positional encodings**
   Add sinusoidal encodings to embeddings so the model knows relative/absolute position; learned positional embeddings work similarly, but they chose sinusoids (helpful for extrapolating to longer sequences). ([arXiv][1])

9. Share weights and embed
   Use learned token embeddings; **tie** the input and output embedding matrices with the pre-softmax linear layer (scaled in the embedding layers). ([arXiv][1])

10. Train on WMT‚Äô14 with big batches
    EN‚ÄìDE: ~4.5M pairs with BPE (~37k vocab). EN‚ÄìFR: 36M pairs with word-piece (~32k). Batch by approximate length; ~25k source + ~25k target tokens per step. ([papers.neurips.cc][2])

11. Optimize with Adam + a warmup schedule
    Adam with Œ≤‚ÇÅ=0.9, Œ≤‚ÇÇ=0.98, œµ=1e-9. Learning rate:
    `lr = d_model^(‚àí0.5) * min(step^(‚àí0.5), step * warmup^(‚àí1.5))`, with **warmup = 4000** steps. ([papers.neurips.cc][2])

12. Regularize
    Apply dropout on sublayer outputs and on (embedding + positional encoding) sums (base uses **P_drop=0.1**). Use **label smoothing = 0.1** to improve BLEU despite slightly worse perplexity. ([papers.neurips.cc][2])

13. Inference setup
    Use **beam search (beam=4)** and **length penalty Œ±=0.6**; average the last 5 checkpoints for base (20 for big). ([papers.neurips.cc][2])

14. Know the two standard sizes

* **Transformer-base:** N=6, d_model=512, d_ff=2048, h=8, d_k=d_v=64, P_drop=0.1, ~65M params.
* **Transformer-big:** N=6, d_model=1024, d_ff=4096, h=16, higher dropout (0.3), ~213M params. 

15. Results to expect
    State-of-the-art machine translation at the time: **28.4 BLEU (EN‚ÜíDE)** and **41.8 BLEU (EN‚ÜíFR)**, with **~12 hours** training for base and **~3.5 days on 8√óP100 GPUs** for big. ([arXiv][1])

16. Why self-attention helps
    Compared to RNNs/CNNs, self-attention shortens the maximum dependency path, boosts parallelism (constant sequential ops per layer), and is competitive in compute‚Äîespecially at typical sentence lengths. ([arXiv][1])

**Prompt**
```md
What are the three most important points in the paper at https://arxiv.org/html/1706.03762v7 ?
```
<!-- prompt:end --> 

**Result**


Here are **three of the most important contributions** / take-away points of *‚ÄúAttention Is All You Need‚Äù* (Vaswani et al. 2017) ([arXiv][1])

---

## 1. A fully attention-based architecture (the Transformer) replacing recurrence and convolution

The paper proposes a new sequence transduction model ‚Äî the **Transformer** ‚Äî that dispenses entirely with recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or convolutions, and relies only on attention mechanisms (self-attention and encoder‚Äìdecoder attention) plus position-wise feed-forward layers. ([arXiv][1])
This allows for much greater parallelism (since dependencies are not computed sequentially across time steps) and more efficient training on modern hardware. ([arXiv][1])

---

## 2. Scaled dot-product attention and multi-head attention

A key technical innovation is the **scaled dot-product attention** mechanism: queries, keys and values are projected into vector spaces, and attention weights are computed by dot products scaled by ‚àöd_k to stabilize gradients. ([arXiv][1])
Moreover, the **multi-head attention** mechanism splits the projections into multiple ‚Äúheads‚Äù that attend in parallel in different subspaces, then concatenates and projects them back. This enables the model to attend to information from different representation subspaces jointly. ([arXiv][1])

---

## 3. Empirical effectiveness: state-of-the-art translation results with faster training

The Transformer achieves superior performance on standard machine translation benchmarks compared to prior RNN / convolutional models, **while being faster to train**. For example, it obtains **28.4 BLEU** on WMT 2014 English‚ÜíGerman, outperforming prior work (including ensembles). ([arXiv][1])
Because of its parallelizability, the model requires significantly less wall-clock training time. ([arXiv][1])
The authors also show that the model generalizes beyond translation (e.g. constituency parsing) with strong performance even with limited task data. ([arXiv][1])

### Prompt - What changed?

<!-- prompt:start -->
**Prompt**
```md
What changed between the pre-war period and the post‚ÄìSpanish Civil War period?
```
<!-- prompt:end -->

**Result**


Could you clarify which context you‚Äôd like me to focus on?

When people talk about differences **between the pre‚ÄìSpanish Civil War period (before 1936)** and the **post‚Äìwar Francoist period (after 1939)**, they might mean different spheres:

* **Politics and governance**

  * *Pre-war:* Spain was under the **Second Republic (1931‚Äì1936)**, a democratic parliamentary system experimenting with progressive reforms (land reform, secularization, women‚Äôs suffrage, autonomy for Catalonia and the Basque Country).
  * *Post-war:* Franco established an **authoritarian dictatorship** (1939‚Äì1975). Political parties and unions were banned (except the Falange), censorship was imposed, and repression of opposition was widespread.

* **Society and culture**

  * *Pre-war:* The Republic expanded education, secularized schools, promoted women‚Äôs rights, and fostered artistic/intellectual freedom.
  * *Post-war:* Reversal to conservative Catholic values. The Church regained control over education and family law. Gender roles were restricted (women lost many rights such as divorce and easy access to work).

* **Economy**

  * *Pre-war:* Attempts at agrarian reform and modernization, but still deeply unequal and unstable.
  * *Post-war:* Spain went through **autarky (self-sufficiency policies)**, which led to severe shortages, black markets, and poverty through the 1940s. Economic liberalization didn‚Äôt come until the late 1950s.

* **Regional autonomy**

  * *Pre-war:* Catalonia and the Basque Country gained autonomy statutes.
  * *Post-war:* Franco abolished regional autonomy, banned minority languages in public life, and pursued centralist policies.

* **International relations**

  * *Pre-war:* Spain was tied into European democratic movements and debates.
  * *Post-war:* Spain was isolated after WWII due to Franco‚Äôs fascist sympathies, only reintegrating into the international community in the 1950s.

üëâ In short: **Spain shifted from a fragile democratic republic experimenting with reform, to a centralized, authoritarian, Catholic, nationalist dictatorship under Franco.**

#### How does this affect everyday life?

<!-- prompt:start -->
**Prompt**
```md
How did the outcome of the Spanish Civil War affect everyday life?
```
<!-- prompt:end -->

**Result**

The outcome of the **Spanish Civil War (1936‚Äì1939)** ‚Äî a victory for Franco‚Äôs Nationalists ‚Äî radically reshaped everyday life in Spain. Here‚Äôs how it affected ordinary people across different aspects of daily living:

---

### 1. **Politics and Freedom**

* **Authoritarian rule:** Political parties, free press, and unions were banned. Expressing dissent risked imprisonment, exile, or execution.
* **Surveillance & fear:** Informants and censorship created a climate of silence; many Spaniards avoided political discussion even in private.
* **Repression:** Thousands were executed or jailed, and many more went into exile. Families of Republicans often faced discrimination.

---

### 2. **Social and Cultural Life**

* **Religion restored to the center:** The Catholic Church regained control over education, marriage, and morality. Schools became religious, and divorce was outlawed.
* **Gender roles:** Women lost rights gained under the Republic (such as divorce, voting freedoms already achieved, and equal work opportunities). Expected role: ‚Äúmother and homemaker.‚Äù
* **Regional identities suppressed:** Catalan, Basque, and Galician languages were banned in schools and public administration; local cultures forced underground.

---

### 3. **Economy and Daily Struggles**

* **Poverty and shortages:** The 1940s (known as *los a√±os del hambre*, ‚Äúthe years of hunger‚Äù) saw rationing, black markets, and malnutrition.
* **Autarky (economic self-sufficiency):** Franco‚Äôs policy isolated Spain, making imported goods scarce and expensive.
* **Work conditions:** Labor unions were banned; workers were forced into state-controlled syndicates. Wages were low, and strikes were illegal.

---

### 4. **Family and Community Life**

* **Discrimination by background:** Families of defeated Republicans often faced restricted job opportunities, social exclusion, and police scrutiny.
* **Education:** Schools emphasized obedience, nationalism, and religion. Textbooks were rewritten to reflect Francoist ideology.
* **Migration:** Many rural poor moved to cities in search of work, and later (1950s‚Äì60s) many Spaniards emigrated abroad for jobs.

---

### 5. **International Isolation**

* In the 1940s, Spain was excluded from the UN and international aid (except limited support from Axis-friendly or later neutral states).
* This worsened shortages and kept Spain technologically and economically behind other European nations until the 1950s‚Äì60s.

---

‚úÖ **In short:**
Life after the war was marked by **fear, repression, hunger, and loss of freedoms.** Ordinary Spaniards lived under a heavily controlled, deeply Catholic, authoritarian society where political dissent, cultural diversity, and social progress were crushed. Only from the late 1950s onward did daily life begin to improve, with economic modernization and limited liberalization.

<!-- prompt:end -->


**Result**

Alright ‚Äî here‚Äôs a **narrative of everyday life after the Spanish Civil War**, told as if through the eyes of an ordinary Spanish family in the early 1940s:

---

### A Family in Post‚ÄìCivil War Spain

We live in a small town outside Madrid. The war ended just a year ago, but it feels like the guns are still echoing in people‚Äôs hearts.

**Father** fought on the Republican side. He survived, but now he cannot find steady work ‚Äî employers avoid hiring ‚Äúreds.‚Äù Each week, he lines up at the town hall to ask about jobs, but mostly he comes home empty-handed. The neighbors whisper, careful not to be overheard, because even words can be dangerous. Someone could report you for disloyalty, and then the police might knock on your door at night.

**Mother** keeps the family together. Food is scarce: bread, oil, and sugar are rationed. She waits in long queues at the ration office, clutching coupons that never stretch far enough. Sometimes she buys on the *estraperlo* (black market), even though it‚Äôs illegal. Potatoes and lentils fill our bellies, but meat is rare. She worries the children look too thin.

**School** has changed. Our teacher now starts the day with Catholic prayers and patriotic songs. We must salute with an outstretched arm and recite praises to Franco. Books are different, too: anything from the old Republic is gone. My older sister used to dream of studying to become a lawyer, but now she‚Äôs told her place is at home, as a mother and homemaker.

**Religion** rules our daily life. The church bells dictate our routines; priests visit classrooms and homes. Mother never leaves the house without covering her head. Divorce, which had been possible before, is forbidden again. The Church teaches that obedience ‚Äî to God, to the father of the family, to the General√≠simo ‚Äî is the highest virtue.

**Community** is divided. Families of Nationalist soldiers walk with pride; families of Republicans keep their heads down. People avoid talking about the past, even with friends, because no one knows who might denounce them. At Sunday mass, everyone sits side by side, but the silence between us says more than words.

At night, we gather around the fire, sharing what little we have. Father sometimes hums old songs from before the war, but quietly, so no one outside hears. Mother prays for peace ‚Äî not political peace, but the kind that means enough food on the table and safety for the children.

---

üëâ For this family, **everyday life is a mix of fear, hunger, and resignation, wrapped in silence and obedience.** Survival depends on keeping quiet, accepting the shortages, and finding small joys in family and faith.

Knowledge Graph (Google)

The Knowledge Graph is a knowledge base from which Google serves relevant information in an infobox beside its search results. This allows the user to see the answer in a glance, as an instant answer. The data is generated automatically from a variety of sources, covering places, people, businesses, and more.[1][2]

The information covered by Google's Knowledge Graph grew quickly after launch, tripling its data size within seven months (covering 570 million entities and 18 billion facts[3]). By mid-2016, Google reported that it held 70 billion facts[4] and answered "roughly one-third" of the 100 billion monthly searches they handled. By May 2020, this had grown to 500 billion facts on 5 billion entities.[5]

There is no official documentation of how the Google Knowledge Graph is implemented.[6] According to Google, its information is retrieved from many sources, including the CIA World Factbook and Wikipedia.[7] It is used to answer direct spoken questions in Google Assistant[8][9] and Google Home voice queries.[10] It has been criticized for providing answers with neither source attribution nor citations.[11]

History
Google announced its Knowledge Graph on May 16, 2012, as a way to significantly enhance the value of information returned by Google searches.[7] Initially available only in English, it was expanded in December 2012 to Spanish, French, German, Portuguese, Japanese, Russian and Italian.[12] Bengali support was added in March 2017.[13]

The Knowledge Graph was powered in part by Freebase.[7]

In August 2014, New Scientist reported that Google had launched a Knowledge Vault project.[14] After publication, Google reached out to Search Engine Land to explain that Knowledge Vault was a research report, not an active Google service. Search Engine Land expressed indications that Google was experimenting with "numerous models" for gathering meaning from text.[15]

Google's Knowledge Vault was meant to deal with facts, automatically gathering and merging information from across the Internet into a knowledge base capable of answering direct questions, such as "Where was Madonna born?" In a 2014 report, the Vault was reported to have collected over 1.6 billion facts, 271 million of which were considered "confident facts" deemed to be more than 90% true. It was reported to be different from the Knowledge Graph in that it gathered information automatically instead of relying on crowd-sourced facts compiled by humans.[15]

Features
Google Knowledge Panel
A Google Knowledge Panel[16] which is part of Google search engine result pages, presents an overview of entities such as individuals, organizations, locations, or objects directly within the search interface. This feature uses data from Google Knowledge Graph,[17] an extensive database that organizes and interconnects information about entities, enhancing the retrieval and presentation of relevant content to users.

Criticism
Lack of source attribution
By May 2016, knowledge boxes were appearing for "roughly one-third" of the 100 billion monthly searches the company processed.[11] Dario Taraborelli, head of research at the Wikimedia Foundation, told The Washington Post that Google's omission of sources in its knowledge boxes "undermines people‚Äôs ability to verify information and, ultimately, to develop well-informed opinions". The publication also reported that the boxes are "frequently unattributed", such as a knowledge box on the age of actress Betty White, which is "as unsourced and absolute as if handed down by God".[11]

Declining Wikipedia article readership
According to The Register in 2014 the display of direct answers in knowledge panels alongside Google search results caused significant readership declines for Wikipedia, from which the panels obtained some of their information.[18] Also in 2014, The Daily Dot noted that "Wikipedia still has no real competitor as far as actual content is concerned. All that's up for grabs are traffic stats. And as a nonprofit, traffic numbers don't equate into revenue in the same way they do for a commercial media site". After the article's publication, a spokesperson for the Wikimedia Foundation, which operates Wikipedia, stated that it "welcomes" the knowledge panel functionality, that it was "looking into" the traffic drops, and that "We've also not noticed a significant drop in search engine referrals. We also have a continuing dialog with staff from Google working on the Knowledge Panel".[19]

In his 2020 book, Dariusz Jemielniak noted that as most Google users do not realize that many answers to their questions that appear in the Knowledge Graph come from Wikipedia, this reduces Wikipedia's popularity, and in turn limited the site's ability to raise new funds and attract new volunteers.[20]

Bias
The algorithm has been criticized for presenting biased or inaccurate information, usually because of sourcing information from websites with high search engine optimization. It had been noted in 2014 that while there was a Knowledge Graph for most major historical or pseudo-historical religious figures such as Moses, Muhammad and Gautama Buddha, there was none for Jesus, the central figure of Christianity.[21][22] On June 3, 2021, a knowledge box identified Kannada as the ugliest language in India, prompting outrage from the Kannada-language community; the state of Karnataka, where most Kannada speakers live, also threatened to sue Google for damaging the public image of the language. Google promptly changed the featured snippet for the search query and issued a formal apology.[23][24]
