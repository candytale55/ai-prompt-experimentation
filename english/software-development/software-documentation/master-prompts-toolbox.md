###  Commenting HTML/CSS/JS

```md
Goal:  
Add descriptive inline comments to code so it‚Äôs easier to navigate, revisit, and understand.  
- Use section headers for major parts.  
- Only explain code that‚Äôs not obvious.  
- If HTML is missing DOCTYPE, lang, charset, or viewport ‚Üí add them.  
- Add accessibility improvements (aria-labels, alt, etc.) without changing structure.  
- Keep a consistent commenting style.  

Input:  
```
```
[Paste HTML, CSS, or JS here]
```

## Commit Message Generator

```md
Goal:  
Generate a clear commit message in markdown format.  
- Always start with a conventional prefix (feat:, fix:, refactor:, chore:, docs:, etc.).  
- Make it understandable even for non-developers.  
- Use bullet points for changes if multiple.  

Input:
```
```  
[Paste description of changes or code snippet]
```

### Final README Formatter

```md
Goal:

- Improve readability and flow.  
- Format cleanly in markdown.  
- Be concise but clear.

### Pseudocode Generator

```md
Goal:  
Convert a finished project into pseudocode comments that can be pasted into an editor as a starting point.  
- Use only comments (`//` for JS, `/* */` for CSS, `<!-- -->` for HTML).  
- Write step-by-step instructions for rebuilding the project.  
- Focus on logic and structure, not full code.  
- Mention gotchas or best practices (like avoiding compounding ems, toggling all themed elements, etc.).  

Input:
```
```  
[Paste the final code here]
```
