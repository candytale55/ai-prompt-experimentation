# Summarize this Technical Newsletter.

## Improved Prompt

### Updated: 2025.09.28

Great, thanks for sharing the prompt! Here’s my review:

### ✅ What’s correct and strong about your prompt

* **Clear task definition**: You specify that the goal is to summarize a newsletter.
* **Target audience clarity**: You mention the reader is a *busy professional*, which helps guide tone and length.
* **Formatting guidance**: You request *short paragraphs and bullet points*, which avoids long walls of text.
* **Focus areas**: You highlight *what’s new, what users can now do, and why it matters*—this creates a strong filter for relevance.
* **Avoiding noise**: You explicitly ask to skip *fluff, generic praise, or overly technical detail*, which helps keep output sharp.

### ⚠️ What could be improved

1. **Input specification**: The prompt doesn’t clarify *how* the newsletter will be provided (as text, PDF, long email). This could lead to inconsistent outputs.
2. **Output format**: While you mention short paragraphs and bullets, you could specify *structure* (e.g., headline → bullets → takeaway) for consistency.
3. **Tone control**: “Concise and actionable” is good, but you might want to guide *voice* (professional, neutral, slightly engaging, etc.).
4. **Actionability clarity**: You ask for “actionable” but don’t define whether that means *steps the reader should take* or just *understanding what’s possible now*.

Would you like me to also create a **meta-prompt template** (so you can reuse it for *any type of newsletter*, not just one specific case)? That way, you’d have a flexible version ready for future use.
