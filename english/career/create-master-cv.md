### Prompt: 

```md
Act as an expert CV writer and career consultant specialized in career transitions into technology.

I will provide my complete CV, which is extensive and somewhat unstructured. Your task is to **extract, organize, and restructure** the information into a **Master Base CV**, designed to be modular so it can be adapted to different job applications later.

**Specific Instructions:**

1. Divide the content into the following sections:

   * Contact Information
   * Professional Summary (3–4 sentences)
   * Technical Skills
   * Software / AI Projects (if none are present, create a placeholder section to be completed later)
   * Professional Experience (organized in blocks by company, with summaries of responsibilities and key achievements; combine overlapping roles under the same employer to simplify)
   * Education & Training
   * Certifications & Courses (grouped by topic, not listed chaotically)
   * Languages
   * Key Achievements & Recognitions (if applicable)
   * Dynamic Module for Job-Specific Adaptation (reserved space for future customization)

2. In the **Professional Experience** section:

   * If I held multiple roles or responsibilities within the same company, combine them into one block under that employer, using subheadings or bullet points to differentiate.
   * Prioritize measurable achievements and relevant projects over long lists of tasks.

3. In the **Education & Certifications** section:

   * Summarize short courses by grouping them by theme (e.g., “Quality & Lean Management,” “International Trade,” “Technology & Software”).
   * Highlight only the most important certifications with their full name and date.

4. The final output should be in a **clear, readable, modular format** (you can use subtitles or table-like structures).

5. Keep the text in English if the input is in English, in Spanish if the input is in Spanish.

6. Do not discard valuable information: if in doubt between omitting or keeping, always keep it.

Once finished, provide me with the cleaned and structured **Master Base CV**.
