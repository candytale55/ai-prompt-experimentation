*MPs are suppossed to be lazy but the are showing too much to watch the Scouts businesses. I think they secretly like them but can't say it outloud, so they fake having to keep an eye on them. They will probably miss them once they leave and things go back to being boring.*

#### Correct outcome:
Hi,

I just finished reading this chapter. It made me laugh a lot, and **left** me a little anxious **because of** that dream sequence.

MPs are **supposed** to be lazy, but **they** are showing too much **interest in** the Scouts' business. I think they secretly like them but can't say it **out loud**, so they fake having to keep an eye on them. They will probably miss them once they leave and things go back to being boring.
