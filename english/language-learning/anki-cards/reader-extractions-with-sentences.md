````md
From a text or a list with words and phrases in English

Display a tab separated list, that can be easily copy-pasted, in English, that contains this output in this exact order: [Vocabulary Word] [Grammatical Type (abbreviation)] [Definition] [Example Sentence] [Tags]

- The Vocabulary Word can be a single word, a compound word, idiomatic expression or phrase.
- If there's a loose word before or after a sentence, the sentence is given as context for the meaning. 
- If there aren't any loose words next to a sentence e that is using it, choose any English above C1-level words found in the text, or the most difficult ones.
- The meaning of the Vocabulary Word should match the context.
- The Definition of the word should include nuances and usage clarifications if applicble.
- If the Vocabulary Word is a conjugated verb, do not mention the infinitive in the Definition, and use the verb tense found in the text as the Verb Word but add the nfinitive between parenthesis next to it.
- The Example Sentence must show only the first letter of each word(s) in the vocabulary item followed by a line, so the user can guess the word. If the word is a compound word, add the second word initial too. 
- The Example Sentence should be long enough to show context. 
- The Tags should be few and concise and related to the context. Separate tags with tabs or spaces (do not use commas).
- For compound words in Tags, use hyphens.
- If the Vocabulary Word has a clear difference in spelling or usage between American and British English, include both versions, indicating the locale as (AM) or (UK) next to each one. Do this only for commonly used words.
